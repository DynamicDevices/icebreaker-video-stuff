Video Stuff
-----------

Just bits and pieces of icebreaker FPGA video stuffins...

- So far, an output driver that's a bit speed-optimized,
  to do 720p (or higher??) on the HDMI output.

Eventually: some kind of framebufferless GPU that's good
at text and tiled graphics both?

License: So far everything in here is CC0. Maybe it will stay that way, maybe later we relicense to CERN or similar.
